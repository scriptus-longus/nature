# nature
This repo contains a few animations of patterns which can be found in nature. It's quite useless but at least it's fun to
watch and code. All animations are generated using python3 (should also work in python2) and matplotlib (and good old mathematics). 

## examples
three double pendulums side by side (all initialized with random starting conditions).
